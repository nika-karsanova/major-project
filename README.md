# major-project
This repository contains files relevant to my BSc dissertation in Aberystwyth University. 

It is primarily a Data Science project put together with Python for the topic of Computer Vision
in sports. The goal was to create a system, which would be able to recognize and identify some basic events in a 
complicated video. Specifically, figure skating broadcast footage.
